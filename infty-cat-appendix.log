The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

     略地说, 一个 $\infty$-范畴含有如下成分: 对象, 对象之间的态射, 态射之间的 $2$-态射, $\cdots$, $k$-态射之间的 $(k+1)$-态射, 以至于无穷. 我们使用的 $\infty$-范畴又称 $(\infty ,1)$-范畴, 意为对所有 $k>1$, $k$-态射都可逆.

l.19 角
      形是用来描述单纯集模型 $\infty$-范畴中一些结构的图形. 如下是角形 $\Lambda_k^2$ ($k=0,1,2$) 的示意图. 可以看到它们是互不同构的单纯集 (尽管它们的几何实现都是互相同胚的), 其中内角形 $\Lambda_1^2$ 中的两个箭头可以复合, 而 $\Lambda_0^2,\Lambda_2^2$ 中的箭头不能复合.
You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

you're probably due for more error messages, and you

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
